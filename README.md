  - **Speed:** Vite is significantly faster than Webpack.
  -  **Configuration Files:** Vite supports two different syntaxes for configuration files—object syntax or export default (the newer syntax).
  -  **Prettier Integration:** Prettier can be used to automatically format and fix code. The write command fixes files, and . applies changes to all files in the project.
  -  **Command Key Tip:** Hold down the Command key to open the localhost link in your browser.

- **String:** Represents text data. Strings in JavaScript are immutable.
- **Number:** Represents numerical values, including floating-point numbers and integers.
- **BigInt:** Handles very large integers beyond the limits of Number.
- **Boolean:** Represents true or false values, useful for logical operations.
- **Symbol:** Unique and immutable values used for unique object property keys.
- **Object:** Collections of key-value pairs. Functions are also objects in JavaScript.
- **Map:** Holds key-value pairs and maintains insertion order, more efficient for certain operations.
- **Set:**  Stores unique values, useful for operations requiring uniqueness.

1. **String Immutability:** Strings cannot be changed once created, which simplifies memory management.
2. **Precision with BigInt:** BigInt allows handling very large integers with precision.
3. **Boolean Logic:** Simplifies conditional logic and decision-making in code.
4. **Unique Symbols:** Symbols ensure unique property keys, avoiding collisions.
5. **Efficient Data Structures:** Maps and Sets provide efficient ways to handle collections and ensure uniqueness.
